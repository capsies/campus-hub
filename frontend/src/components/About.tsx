          Hey there! We're a small team of final-year Computer science students
          building CampusHub to replace the current manual system for managing
          departmental activities. Our goal? To make managing multiple
          departmental activities easier, more organized, and a little less
          chaotic.

            (And yes, itâ€™s way better than flipping through dusty old records!
